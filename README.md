A starting point, using Python, for the String Calculator Kata - http://nimblepros.com/media/36628/string%20calculator%20kata.pdf

I've used unittest (http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html) to run my
tests however I think there are more advanced testrunners available.

Tests can be run with:
$ python3 StringCalculatorTest.py
